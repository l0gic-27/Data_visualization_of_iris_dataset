Visualizations
The notebook contains the following visualizations:

Pair Plot: Visualizes pairwise relationships in the dataset using scatter plots and histograms, colored by sepal width.

Pie Chart: Displays the frequency of each species in the dataset.

Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between sepal length and sepal width, with points colored by species.

Feature Distribution: Uses pair plots to visualize the distribution of sepal and petal features, colored by petal width.

Joint Plot: Highlights the relationship between sepal length and sepal width using a scatter plot.

KDE Plots: Kernel Density Estimation plots for the 'Setosa' species, visualizing sepal and petal features.
